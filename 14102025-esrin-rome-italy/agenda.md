# Overview

The STAC+Zarr Community Sprint runs for 2.5 days, October 14, 15, and 16th, 2025 at ESA ESRIN in Frascati, Italy. The main activities will run 9:00-17:00 Central European Time (CEST). Each day we will have a kickoff in the morning at 9:00 as one big group. Most work through the sprint will be done in smaller groups, who will work for a time and then come together to report out and get feedback from other groups.

The format follows Tuesday-Wednesday full days, with Thursday morning sessions and closing plenary at 14:00.

### Venue Information

**Location:** ESA ESRIN, Frascati, Italy

### Remote Participation

This sprint is designed primarily for in-person collaboration and hands-on development work. Remote participation options are limited due to the intensive, collaborative nature of the technical work planned.

## Sprint Objectives

This sprint focuses on advancing STAC and Zarr integration, with particular emphasis on cloud-native geospatial data access and the European Open Science Platform Framework (EOPF) requirements.

### Technical Focus Areas

- **Zarr Store navigation and discovery** - Enhancing capabilities for discovering and navigating Zarr data stores

- **STAC collection assets for Zarr stores** - Developing standards for representing Zarr data in STAC catalogs
- **Link Templates Extension applications** - Advancing templating capabilities for dynamic data access
- **Virtual Zarr integration with STAC** - Exploring virtual Zarr concepts within STAC workflows
- **EOPF-specific use cases and requirements** - Addressing European space data platform needs

### Community Development

- Strengthen collaboration between STAC and Zarr communities
