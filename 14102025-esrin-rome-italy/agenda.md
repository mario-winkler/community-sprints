# Overview

The STAC+Zarr Community Sprint runs for 2.5 days, October 14, 15, and 16th, 2025 at ESA ESRIN in Frascati, Italy. The main activities will run 9:00-17:00 Central European Time (CEST). Each day we will have a kickoff in the morning at 9:00 as one big group. Most work through the sprint will be done in smaller groups, who will work for a time and then come together to report out and get feedback from other groups.

The format follows Tuesday-Wednesday full days, with Thursday morning sessions and closing plenary at 14:00.

### Venue Information

**Location:** ESA ESRIN, Frascati, Italy. [How to get to ESRIN](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN/Getting_to_ESRIN).

- Main room for plenary sessions
- 4 breakout rooms for working groups (~10 people each)
- Participant capacity: 40 attendees (max 1-2 per organization)

**Transportation:** Clear directions available from Rome Termini train connection
**Catering:** ESA mensa confirmed (voucher provided to participants)

### Remote Participation

This sprint is designed primarily for in-person collaboration and hands-on development work. Remote participation options are limited due to the intensive, collaborative nature of the technical work planned. External participants may follow issues and pull requests on relevant GitHub repositories, but active remote participation during the sprint sessions is not supported.

## Sprint Objectives

This sprint focuses on advancing STAC and Zarr integration, with particular emphasis on cloud-native geospatial data access and the European Open Science Platform Framework (EOPF) requirements.

### Proposed Specification Topics

Based on participant expertise and interests, 6 specification topics have been identified for potential breakout groups. **4 topics will be selected** on Day 1 based on participant alignment and community priorities:

1. **STAC-Zarr Asset Discovery and Data Access Patterns** - Standardized patterns for asset organization, navigation, and templating capabilities for dynamic data access
2. **EOPF Integration Specification** - ESA-specific STAC patterns for Sentinel products in Zarr format
3. **Datacube Extension Enhancement for Zarr** - Improving multidimensional data support and CF convention integration
4. **STAC Browser and Visualization Support** - Specification patterns for effective visualization and browsing
5. **Performance and Access Optimization** - Guidelines for optimizing STAC-Zarr integration performance, including virtual Zarr stores
6. **Zarr Store Best Practices Specification** - Foundational concept mapping and best practices for representing Zarr stores in STAC (synthesis topic for later days)

Of course, these are proposed topics. Any other relevant topics may be proposed and selected on Day 1 as well if there is sufficient interest and expertise.

Each selected topic will form a breakout group of 4-6 participants with diverse expertise to ensure comprehensive coverage and practical outcomes.

### Community Development

- Strengthen collaboration between STAC and Zarr communities
- Share implementation experiences and best practices
- Identify and address ecosystem gaps
- Plan future development priorities
