# About

This directory is a workspace to collaborate and prepare for the STAC sprint. Everyone is welcome
to edit files and make new workspaces - just make a PR and we will get your information into main. Work will also take place
in other repositories that are specific to the STAC specifications or ecosystem; this space just serves as a collaboration space
with a low barrier to entry.

For the main sprint schedule, check the [agenda](../agenda.md).

# Meetings to Attend

There are a handful of STAC meetings occurring in the time leading up to the STAC. We encourage STAC sprint attendees to make as many of the upcoming meetings as possible to get everyone as up-to-speed as possible before the sprint.

#### STAC Community Meeting

General meeting about all things stac-spec and stac-api-spec. The meeting consists of (1) intros and updates from each meeting participant and (2) agenda items (created by anyone that attends the meeting).

**Meeting time:** Every other Monday from 11 am - 12 pm EST (1-hour long meeting)

- Monday, September 8th @ 11 am EST
- Monday, September 22 @ 11 am EST
- Monday, October 6th @ 11 am EST

# Topics

This sprint has a specific focus on STAC + Zarr as we would like to reach a point where we can have a set of recommendations for how to use STAC with Zarr, and how to use Zarr with STAC.

There are three main categories of topics, and each has its own page or directory to go deeper on. These should serve
to get people working on the topic on the same page before the sprint. Each should have a number of links to give a newer
user the appropriate background and should attempt to frame the major points of the decision. These will likely be various
degrees of WIP (work in progress), as everyone is too busy ahead of the sprint, but something started is better than nothing.

* **[Specification Improvements](specification-topics.md)** - Both [stac-spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) and [stac-api-spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec) have reached a stable version. Specific topics of work can be found in [specification-topics.md](specification-topics.md).

* **[Ecosystem Development/Implementation](implementation-topics.md)** - The goal of these sprints is to build - software, hosted datasets, testing
tools, etc - with the specification being a side-effect of people working together. So if people are not sure where to
contribute then jumping on this area is one of the best. The [implementation page](implementation-topics.md) details the various
projects people are working on, as well as ideas for new datasets/software, and you can also offer up your skills there.
Testing and validation are also a part of this.

* **[Outreach & Education](outreach-and-education-topics.md)** - TBD
