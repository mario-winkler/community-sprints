# About

This directory is a workspace to collaborate and prepare for the STAC sprint. Everyone is welcome
to edit files and make new workspaces - just make a PR and we will get your information into main. Work will also take place
in other repositories that are specific to the STAC specifications or ecosystem; this space just serves as a collaboration space
with a low barrier to entry.

For the main sprint schedule, check the [agenda](../agenda.md).

# Meetings to Attend

There are a handful of STAC meetings occurring in the time leading up to the STAC. We encourage STAC sprint attendees to make as many of the upcoming meetings as possible to get everyone as up-to-speed as possible before the sprint.

#### STAC Community Meeting

General meeting about all things stac-spec and stac-api-spec. The meeting consists of (1) intros and updates from each meeting participant and (2) agenda items (created by anyone that attends the meeting).

**Meeting time:** Every other Monday from 11 am - 12 pm EST (1-hour long meeting)

- Monday, September 8th @ 11 am EST
- Monday, September 22 @ 11 am EST
- Monday, October 6th @ 11 am EST

# Topics

This sprint has a **primary focus on STAC + Zarr specification development** to establish robust standards, best practices, and guidelines for STAC-Zarr integration. The goal is to reach consensus on how to use STAC with Zarr and how to use Zarr with STAC through specification work.

Given the 3-day sprint timeframe, the main deliverables will be **specification documents, best practices, and guidelines** rather than production software implementations.

Prior to the sprint, feel free to propose additional topics or areas of focus that align with the overall sprint goals.

## Primary Focus: Specification Development

* **[Specification Topics](specification-topics.md)** - The **main focus** of the sprint. Six proposed specification topics have been identified for breakout groups, with 4 to be selected based on participant expertise and community priorities. Topics include Zarr best practices, asset patterns, EOPF integration, datacube extension enhancements, visualization support, and performance optimization.

## Supporting Activities

* **[Implementation Topics](implementation-topics.md)** - Implementation work will be **secondary** and will emerge organically from specification discussions. This includes proof-of-concept prototypes to validate specification decisions, reference examples, and gap identification. Participants may propose implementation topics that align with sprint goals.

* **[Outreach & Education](outreach-and-education-topics.md)** - TBD

## Real-World Examples

The sprint preparation includes analysis of existing STAC-Zarr implementations:

- **EOAP Zarr Cloud-Native Workflows**: Producer/consumer application packages demonstrating collection assets and datacube extension usage
- **EOPF Sample Service**: Live Sentinel-2 L2A catalog showing multi-resolution asset patterns, hierarchical data access, and engine-specific parameters

These examples provide concrete patterns that will inform specification development and ensure practical applicability of the standards being developed.
