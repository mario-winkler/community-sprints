## About

One major use case to be considered during this sprint is the evolution of the data format of the Copernicus Sentinel missions towards a format based on Zarr, as defined in the EO Processing Framework (EOPF) initiative by ESA. The [EOPF Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/) provides a rolling archive of products converted from SAFE to EOPF and makes them discoverable in a STAC catalog. Together with the [EOPF Toolkit](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit) and the [EOPF Explorer](https://github.com/EOPF-Explorer) projects, the distribution, visualisation, tooling support and user uptake of the new format is fostered.

This folder contains some preparative material to be considered as background information for the work on the specification topics during the sprint.
