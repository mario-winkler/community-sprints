# Implementation Topics - Supporting Specification Development

## Overview

This STAC + Zarr community sprint at ESA/ESRIN will **primarily focus on [specification](specification-topics.md) development**, with implementation work arising organically from specification discussions. The main goal is to develop robust specifications, best practices, and guidelines for STAC-Zarr integration.

Given the 3-day sprint timeframe, implementation activities will serve to:

- **Validate specification decisions** through proof-of-concept implementations
- **Test proposed patterns** with real-world data and use cases
- **Identify gaps** in current tooling that specifications need to address
- **Create reference examples** that demonstrate specification compliance

## Approach to Implementation Work

Implementation work during the sprint should be **secondary to specification development** and will emerge from:

1. **Specification validation needs** - Building small prototypes to test proposed patterns
2. **Participant interest** - Some participants may choose to implement concepts discussed in spec groups
3. **Reference example creation** - Developing examples that demonstrate specification compliance
4. **Gap identification** - Discovering implementation challenges that inform specification decisions

BUT any participant may propose implementation topics or areas of focus that align with the overall sprint goals and organize a group around them.

## Participant Inputs

### EOAP Zarr Cloud-Native Workflows

Based on participant input, the following real-world implementation examples provide valuable context for sprint discussions:

#### Earth Observation Application Packages (EOAP)

Reference implementation: [EOAP Zarr Cloud-Native Format](https://eoap.github.io/zarr-cloud-native-format/exploitation/)

**Key Implementation Patterns Demonstrated:**

- Collection assets with `application/vnd+zarr` media type
- Datacube extension for multidimensional metadata
- xarray:open_kwargs for Zarr-specific parameters
- Consolidated metadata usage for performance
- Spatial reference system encoding in Zarr
- Time dimension handling in STAC collections

**Technical Specifications Observed:**

- Asset roles: `["data", "zarr"]`
- Media type: `application/vnd+zarr`
- Datacube dimensions: spatial (x, y) and temporal
- Chunking strategy: `[512, 512, 1]` for time-series data
- Coordinate reference system: EPSG codes in datacube extension

**Integration Points for Sprint Discussion:**

- Standardization of Zarr asset roles and media types
- Best practices for consolidated metadata handling
- Datacube extension alignment with Zarr conventions
- Performance optimization for cloud-native access
- Workflow patterns for producer/consumer applications
